    <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello my name is Tony Frazzini. Music is my driving force. I started playing guitar at age 15. My earliest influences were all Seattle bands of the 90s. Alice in Chains and Soudgarden in particular kept the 
       wheels going in my mind for me to stick with playing. Music opened the doors to other passions 
       in life which include going to film school in Los Angeles. In California I learned a great deal 
       of independence. I started working on cars at my Uncles friends shop. From there I learned how 
       to work and modify my own car. Then from gaining mechanical knowledge it helped when I transitioned 
       into heating and cooling when I moved home to Buffalo.</p>
