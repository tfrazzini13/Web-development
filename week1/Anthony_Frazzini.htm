    <h1 style="color:blue;">About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello my name is Tony Frazzini. Music is my driving force. I started playing guitar at age 15. My earliest
        influences were all Seattle bands of the 90s. Alice in Chains and Soudgarden in particular kept the
        wheels going in my mind for me to stick with playing. Music opened the doors to other passions
        in life which include going to film school in Los Angeles. In California I learned a great deal
        of independence. I started working on cars at my Uncles friends shop. From there I learned how
        to work and modify my own car. Then from gaining mechanical knowledge it helped when I transitioned
        into heating and cooling when I moved home to Buffalo.
